**Potential Domains of Interest**
- Sports, mainly football
- Websites, seeing how many people view a certain site

I am interested football data because of all the different statistics it has for its players.

Websites seem to keep track of data to help it function and improve.


**Data Science Questions**

- I think the amount of sucessful passes and yards gained from games would be able to tell what player has the highest chance of having the most projected points.
