Introduction to data science assignment 1

**Potential Domains of Interest**
- Sports, mainly football
- Websites, seeing how many people view a certain site

I am interested football data because of all the different statistics it has for its players.

Websites seem to keep track of data to help it function and improve.


**Data Science Questions**
- Which quarterback has the most projected points in fantasy football this year?
- I think the amount of sucessful passes and yards gained from games would be able to tell what player has the highest chance of having the most projected points.

**Potential Data**
- [link to nfl fantasy stats](https://fantasy.nfl.com/research/scoringleaders?position=1#researchScoringLeaders=researchScoringLeaders%2C%2Fresearch%2Fscoringleaders%253Fposition%253D1%2526sort%253Dpts%2526statCategory%253Dstats%2526statSeason%253D2020%2526statType%253DseasonStats%2Creplace)
- This data comes from nfl fantasy website.
- The data shows yard gained, touch downs, and interceptions.
- The data is from last year and it doesn't mention any injuries that the quarterback sustained, so it's not up to date currently.
